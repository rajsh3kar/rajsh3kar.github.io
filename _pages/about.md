I am a PhD Scholar in Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Bhilai, working on cutting-edge research in **ML Systems**, **Federated Learning**, and **Edge Computing**.

My research focuses on developing efficient algorithms and systems for resource-constrained environments, particularly in:
- **Reinforcement Learning for System Optimization**
- **Real-Time Federated Learning**
- **UAV Networks and Dynamic Deployment**
- **Edge Computing and Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC)**

I leverage machine learning techniques to solve complex networking and distributed systems problems, with publications in top-tier conferences (IEEE ICDCS, IEEE NOMS) and journals (Springer JNSM).

**Research Interests:** ML Systems • Federated Learning • Edge Computing • Reinforcement Learning • UAV Networks • Distributed Systems
